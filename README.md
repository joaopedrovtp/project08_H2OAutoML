# Project08 - Using H2OAutoML to predict Energy Consumption
 
In this project I used H2O AutoML to predict energy consumption. AutoML is a function in H2O that automates the process of building a large number of models, with the goal of finding the "best" model without any prior knowledge or effort by the Data Scientist. For more information see this documentation (http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html)


This was a case study for Data Science Academy.
