# Project08 - Using H2OAutoML to predict Energy Consumption
 
In this case I used H2O AutoML to predict energy consumption. AutoML is a function in H2O that automates the process of building a large number of models, with the goal of finding the "best" model without any prior knowledge or effort by the Data Scientist. For more information see this documentation (http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html)

Project:
"Electrical energy consumption analysis is critical to saving energy, and therefore more and more attention has been paid to make a consumption prediction. However, there are so many factorrs in the building that affect the ernergy consumption of eletrical appliances that it's hard to get an efficient method."

For more details about the problem and dataset analysis you can see in this book:

This was a case study for Data Science Academy.
